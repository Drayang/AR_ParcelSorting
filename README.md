## Utilise SceneView library to implement AR application

### Monash Univeristy Mechatronics Engineering Final Year Project:

With the constantly increasing use of delivery services in the recent years, safe and efficient parcel delivery is an ongoing issue under
investigation. Drivers have to ensure that the parcels are stacked in order of location of delivery, weight, size and fragility, which
proves cumbersome when everything has to be done manually. This project aims to address this by using a smart glass to help
drivers keep track of the parcels and providing suggestions on the best order of storage. In addition to this, after storage, the glasses
would be able to assist drivers to locate the parcels by indicating a selected parcel via AR methods in a given 3D space.
